# CTF

Ethereum is a representative product of Blockchain 2.0, which inherits various features of blockchain because of its underlying blockchain technology, one of which is that once the code is on the chain, it is difficult to tamper or change, so we need to pay extra attention to its security.

Smart Contract is one of the most important concepts in Ethereum, allowing trusted transactions to be made without a third party, and these transactions are traceable and irreversible.
