# BlockChain in CTF

Ethereum is a representative product of Blockchain 2.0, which inherits various features of blockchain because of its underlying blockchain technology, one of which is that once the code is on the chain, it is difficult to tamper or change, so we need to pay extra attention to its security.

Smart Contract is one of the most important concepts in Ethereum, allowing trusted transactions to be made without a third party, and these transactions are traceable and irreversible.

Blockchain in CTF 
The CTF is relatively straightforward with respect to Ethereum Security, which mainly involves Solidity Security.

Requirements:

·Knowledge of blockchain basics and the nature of transactions.

·Familiarity and mastery of Solidity programming language and Ethernet virtual machine EVM operation mechanism.

·Familiarity with various test chains, including private chains.

·Familiar with Remix, MetaMask, web3.js, web3.py and other tools or libraries.

·Understand and master various vulnerabilities of ethereum smart contracts and their attack principles.

·Thorough understanding of underlying opcodes.

·Strong program understanding and reverse analysis ability.
